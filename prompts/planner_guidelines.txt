## 1. STATIC/DYNAMIC CONTENT

* **Static vs. Dynamic:** In a paper designed for 100 questions, approximately **70%** of the content must be based on **static, core conceptual knowledge**, and **30%** must draw from **current developments (dynamic)**.
* **Current Affairs Integration:** Questions must derive from current news or reports but must test the **underlying static, conceptual knowledge**. Avoid date-sensitive facts. Use expressions like "**recently**," "**in the context of**," or "**as of [Year]**" to maintain relevance.
